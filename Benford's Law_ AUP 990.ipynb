    "   Benford's Law is based around the idea that numbers aren't evenly distributed in nature. They are distributed abnormally. When examining the first digit of every number from a set, a distinct distribution emerges that appears in all sorts of data sets (see link below). A Benford Analysis leverages this information by comparing numbers on SEC filings, population sizes, street names to the expected value those numbers should be based on Benford's Law and looks for discrepancies between the two.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Often discrepancies could mean fraud is involved. For example, Enron's financial statements do not follow Benford's Law while the line count of the *Rails* 3.0.9 source code does (https://testingbenfordslaw.com/rails-core-line-count). \n",
    "    \n",
    "   On this project we will use the American University of Paris's 2017 990 tax returns as our reference material. Our goal is to use python to examine these tax returns and to determine if they follow Benford's law, and if they do not, what numbers could possibly be fraudulent because of this. At the end we will examine what accounts contain numbers in positions that are not distributed as they should be, then make a recommendation based off of this information as to what accounts should be audited in search of fraud."
